Token Staking Process
Entering a Match:
Before a 1v1 push-up challenge begins, players can stake tokens (e.g., the { token name} as part of the entry into the match. Both players agree to stake a certain number of tokens, creating a prize pool.
For example, Player A and Player B each stake 100 {tokens}, creating a prize pool of 200 {tokens}.

Smart Contract Mechanism:
A smart contract is created (using Solana’s Anchor framework) to handle the staked tokens and ensure fairness.
The contract locks the tokens from both players before the game begins. Once tokens are staked, they are held securely until the match concludes.

Game Monitoring and Fair Play:
As the game progresses, the AI monitors both players’ performances via the web camera, ensuring that all push-ups are counted accurately based on form.
The AI’s judgment of form correctness ensures no one can cheat or manipulate the game to win the staked tokens unfairly.

Declaring a Winner:
At the end of the 30-second challenge, the player with the most correct push-ups wins the match.
The smart contract automatically transfers the prize pool (the staked tokens) to the winner’s wallet.


Optional Features:
Spectator Betting: In advanced matches, spectators might also stake tokens on who they think will win, adding a layer of engagement.
Leaderboard Bonuses: Players who win consistently could unlock higher staking tiers or bonus rewards, incentivizing players to bet bigger amounts.
Security & Transparency:
Solana’s blockchain ensures transparency, and smart contracts govern the token transfers without the need for intermediaries. The staking process is automated and trustless, meaning the system ensures that tokens are awarded based on performance.

Storyboard: Token Staking Process for 1v1 Push-up Challenge

Scene 1: Player Login and Wallet Integration
Frame 1: User Authentication
Description: Player A and Player B access the app’s homepage.
Technical Requirement: Implement an email-based authentication system (OAuth or JWT-based) for logging into the platform.
Tech Notes:
Use standard email authentication methods.
SDK for email login should be connected with the app's authentication API.

Frame 2: Wallet Integration via SDK
Description: After login, both players connect their Solana wallets (e.g., Photom Wallet) to the game platform via an SDK.
Technical Requirement: Integrate Solana SDK for wallet connection and manage the wallet address in the backend for future transactions.
Tech Notes:
Use Solana SDK for Solana wallet connection.
Store wallet addresses securely for token transactions.
Photom wallet SDK will handle user authentication and token transfers.

Scene 2: Token Staking Mechanism
Frame 1: Match Creation and Token Staking
Description: Both players agree to stake a specific number of tokens (e.g., 100 tokens each), which creates a prize pool.
Technical Requirement:
Create a match instance with predefined parameters: player IDs, tokens staked, and prize pool.
Send a request to a Solana smart contract to hold the staked tokens in escrow.
Tech Notes:
The contract should be created using Solana’s Anchor framework.
The contract will receive and hold the staked tokens.
Each player’s wallet sends a transaction to deposit tokens into the smart contract.
The prize pool is calculated dynamically: prize_pool = player_A_stake + player_B_stake.

Frame 2: Tokens Locked in Escrow
Description: Once both players have staked tokens, the smart contract locks the tokens in escrow until the match is finished.
Technical Requirement:
The smart contract must lock tokens in an escrow account until a function (triggered after the game concludes) releases the tokens to the winner.
Tech Notes:
Use Solana Program Library (SPL) tokens for handling the token transfer.
Use Solana’s Anchor framework to create the escrow mechanism.
Ensure the smart contract is properly initialized with both players' staked tokens.

Scene 3: Game Proceeds
Frame 1: Match Execution
Description: The push-up challenge begins, with both players competing.
Technical Requirement: Integrate a game engine or API that tracks the progress of the 1v1 push-up challenge.
Tech Notes:
Use an external game service to track the performance of both players in real-time (e.g., using body tracking APIs or manual input from players).
The game sends the match outcome (Player A wins or Player B wins) to the backend.

Scene 4: Declaring the Winner
Frame 1: Match Result Processing
Description: Once the challenge ends, the winner (Player A or Player B) is declared based on the push-up results.
Technical Requirement:
The backend should process the game outcome and call the Solana smart contract to release the tokens to the winner.

Tech Notes:
Backend server or game logic triggers a smart contract function to transfer tokens from the escrow to the winning player’s wallet address.
The smart contract verifies the game outcome and releases the tokens accordingly.

Scene 5: Token Transfer to Winner
Frame 1: Transfer of Tokens
Description: The prize pool (200 tokens) is transferred to the winner's Solana wallet.
Technical Requirement:
The smart contract releases tokens from escrow and sends them to the winner’s wallet address using SPL token transfer.
Tech Notes:
The smart contract function calls the Token::transfer method to execute the token transfer.
Ensure the token transfer is confirmed on the Solana blockchain (e.g., using Solana’s transaction confirmation API).

Frame 2: Confirmation and UI Update
Description: Both players receive confirmation of the match result, and the winning player’s wallet is updated with the prize pool.
Technical Requirement:
The frontend UI displays the transaction result and updates the winner's token balance.
Tech Notes:
Use WebSockets or APIs to reflect real-time wallet balance updates.
Display a summary of the match result and the new token balance for the winner.

Smart Contract Flow Diagram
Players Stake Tokens: Both Player A and Player B send their tokens to a smart contract using Solana's Anchor framework.
Escrow Locks Tokens: The smart contract locks the tokens in an escrow account.
Game Proceeds: Players compete in the push-up challenge.
Winner Declared: Backend or external game service declares the winner.
Tokens Released: The smart contract sends all staked tokens to the winner’s wallet.

Backend: Node.js/Express.js for managing user authentication, game state, and smart contract calls.
Blockchain Framework: Solana’s Anchor framework for smart contracts, using SPL tokens for staking and prize distribution.
Game Engine/Service: Any body-tracking or input-based engine to verify challenge outcomes.

Improvement Example:
#[error_code]
pub enum GameError {
    #[msg("Game is not active")]
    GameNotActive,
    #[msg("The bet amount does not match the required stake")]
    IncorrectBetAmount,
    #[msg("Game resulted in a draw")]
    Draw,
    #[msg("Insufficient funds for token transfer")]
    InsufficientFunds,
    #[msg("Player is not authorized to end the game")]
    UnauthorizedPlayer,
}
Add more specific error codes to make debugging and handling issues easier.
. Implement Timeout Mechanism for Inactive Games

pub fn initialize_game(
    ctx: Context<InitializeGame>,
    player1: Pubkey,
    player2: Pubkey,
    bet_amount: u64,
    game_duration: i64, // Unix timestamp indicating how long the game should stay active
) -> Result<()> {
    let game = &mut ctx.accounts.game;
    game.player1 = player1;
    game.player2 = player2;
    game.bet_amount = bet_amount;
    game.is_active = true;
    game.end_time = Clock::get()?.unix_timestamp + game_duration; // Store the end time of the game
    Ok(())
}

pub fn end_game(ctx: Context<EndGame>, player1_points: u64, player2_points: u64) -> Result<()> {
    let game = &mut ctx.accounts.game;
    let current_time = Clock::get()?.unix_timestamp;

    require!(game.is_active, GameError::GameNotActive);
    require!(current_time <= game.end_time, GameError::GameExpired); // Ensure game is not expired

    // Existing logic to determine the winner and transfer tokens
    Ok(())
}
Program-Derived Addresses (PDAs)
pub fn into_transfer_to_escrow_context(&self) -> CpiContext<'_, '_, '_, 'info, Transfer<'info>> {
    let (escrow_authority, _escrow_bump) = Pubkey::find_program_address(
        &[b"escrow", self.escrow_account.to_account_info().key.as_ref()],
        &crate::ID,
    );
    
    let cpi_accounts = Transfer {
        from: self.player.to_account_info().clone(),
        to: self.escrow_account.to_account_info().clone(),
        authority: escrow_authority, // Use the PDA as the authority
    };
    CpiContext::new(self.token_program.clone(), cpi_accounts)
}

Optimize Token Transfer Logic
pub fn end_game(ctx: Context<EndGame>, player1_points: u64, player2_points: u64) -> Result<()> {
    let game = &mut ctx.accounts.game;
    let (winner, loser) = if player1_points > player2_points {
        (game.player1, game.player2)
    } else if player2_points > player1_points {
        (game.player2, game.player1)
    } else {
        return err!(GameError::Draw);
    };

    let total_escrow_balance = game.bet_amount * 2;
    let platform_fee = total_escrow_balance / 10;
    let winner_amount = total_escrow_balance - platform_fee;

    let seeds = &[b"escrow", game.to_account_info().key.as_ref()];
    let signer_seeds = &[&seeds[..]];

    // Perform token transfers using CPI with the PDA as the authority
    token::transfer(
        ctx.accounts.into_transfer_to_winner_context(winner)
            .with_signer(signer_seeds), 
        winner_amount
    )?;
    token::transfer(
        ctx.accounts.into_transfer_to_platform_context()
            .with_signer(signer_seeds), 
        platform_fee
    )?;

    game.is_active = false;

    Ok(())
}

Fee Flexibility
Allow the platform fee percentage to be adjustable, either from an admin account or passed as a parameter during game initialization. This makes the system more flexible.


pub fn initialize_game(
    ctx: Context<InitializeGame>,
    player1: Pubkey,
    player2: Pubkey,
    bet_amount: u64,
    platform_fee: u8, // Percentage fee for the platform
) -> Result<()> {
    require!(platform_fee <= 100, GameError::InvalidFee);
    let game = &mut ctx.accounts.game;
    game.player1 = player1;
    game.player2 = player2;
    game.bet_amount = bet_amount;
    game.platform_fee = platform_fee; // Store the platform fee
    game.is_active = true;
    Ok(())
}

pub fn end_game(ctx: Context<EndGame>, player1_points: u64, player2_points: u64) -> Result<()> {
    let game = &mut ctx.accounts.game;
    let total_escrow_balance = game.bet_amount * 2;
    let platform_fee = (total_escrow_balance * game.platform_fee as u64) / 100;
    let winner_amount = total_escrow_balance - platform_fee;

    // Transfer logic remains the same
    Ok(())
}

Player Participation Validation
To ensure fairness, you could add a check to prevent unauthorized players from interacting with certain game functions (e.g., joining or ending a game).
require!(ctx.accounts.player.key() == game.player1 || ctx.accounts.player.key() == game.player2, GameError::UnauthorizedPlayer);

Ensure Account Rent Exemption
Ensure that accounts like the game or escrow account are rent-exempt on Solana, as Solana requires accounts to maintain enough balance to avoid being reclaimed.

#[account(init, payer = payer, space = 8 + 32 + 32 + 8 + 1, rent_exempt = enforce)]
pub game: Account<'info, Game>,

Storyboard: Token Staking Process in a 1v1 Challenge using Solana & Escrow with Anchor

1. User Login and Match Entry
Player A and Player B both log into the game platform using their email accounts.
Each player is then prompted to log into their wallet (via the Photom Wallet SDK) to connect to the Solana blockchain and enable token staking.
The players then navigate to the "1v1 Push-up Challenge" section of the platform.
2. Game Initialization
Player A selects Player B for a match.
Both players agree to a bet amount of 100 tokens each. The game is initiated through a smart contract built using Solana's Anchor framework.
A game session is created with the following key attributes:
Player 1's public key
Player 2's public key
Bet amount (100 tokens each, total prize pool = 200 tokens)
Platform fee set to 10% by default
Game expiration time is set (e.g., 24 hours)
Game is marked as active in the smart contract
Smart Contract Method: initialize_game
3. Token Escrow & PDA Setup
After initialization, both Player A and Player B must stake their tokens:
Each player transfers 100 tokens to a secure escrow account (controlled by a PDA) to lock the prize pool.
The tokens are held securely in the escrow account under the control of the program (via PDA).
The smart contract checks:
If the game is active
If the bet amount is correct (100 tokens)
If the players are authorized to join the game
If everything is valid, the tokens are transferred into the escrow.
Smart Contract Method: join_game
Security Mechanism:
PDA (Program-Derived Address) is used as the escrow account authority to ensure only the program can manage the escrowed tokens, preventing unauthorized transfers.
4. Game Play and Completion
The players participate in the push-up challenge, and after completing the challenge, the points (number of push-ups) are recorded:
Player A scores 80 push-ups
Player B scores 90 push-ups
5. Game End and Winner Declaration
Once the game is completed, the results (points) are submitted to the smart contract by an authorized party (e.g., a game oracle or verified third-party service).
The smart contract validates:
The game is still active
The result submission is within the game expiration window (i.e., the match was completed on time)
Smart Contract Method: end_game
The smart contract checks the points:
Player B is declared the winner with 90 points, compared to Player A's 80 points.
If the game had resulted in a tie, the contract would handle the scenario accordingly (e.g., draw or refund tokens).
6. Token Distribution & Platform Fee
After determining the winner, the tokens are distributed:
Total prize pool in escrow: 200 tokens (100 tokens from each player)
Platform fee: 10% (20 tokens)
Winner’s share: 180 tokens
The token transfers are executed:
180 tokens are transferred from the escrow account to Player B's wallet.
20 tokens are transferred from the escrow account to the platform’s wallet as a platform fee.
The token transfers are handled using PDA as the authority to ensure security.
The game is then marked as inactive in the smart contract, and the session is closed.
Smart Contract Methods:
into_transfer_to_winner_context: Transfers tokens to the winner.
into_transfer_to_platform_context: Transfers platform fees to the platform account.

Security & Validation Checks
Escrow Management: Tokens are securely locked and only transferred out upon game completion, using a PDA to prevent unauthorized access.
Expiration Handling: If the game exceeds the predefined expiration time (e.g., 24 hours), the game is canceled or the tokens are refunded.
Fee Flexibility: The platform fee is set to a default of 10% but can be adjusted for different game modes or admin needs.
Player Validation: Only Player A or Player B can participate in or end the game.
